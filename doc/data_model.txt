required values:

maximum age: recursion depth --> int


other values have to be defined for at lesat max and min age (0)


thickness(age, probability) // regular thickness and its deviation

length(age, probability) // length of the branches and some deviation (sligthly longer/shorter branches)

branching(age)[number of branches and probability] (tripel)

branchingAngle(age) // flat or steep

branchingRotation(age) // random deviation of exact rotation angle (360°/numOfBranches +- deviation)

gravitationInfluence(age) // influence of gravitation, branches bend towards earth

growthInterruption(age, probability) // an interrutption in growth, leaving some years out

wobbliness(age, probability) // curved branches
