required values:

maximum age: recursion depth --> int


other values have to be defined for at lesat max and min age (0)


thickness(age, deviation) // regular thickness and its deviation

length(age, deviation) // length of the branches and some deviation (sligthly longer/shorter branches)

branching(age, probability)[number of branches and probability] (tripel)

branchingAngle(age, deviation) // flat or steep, with some deviation

branchingRotation(age, deviation) // random deviation of exact rotation angle (360°/numOfBranches +- deviation)

gravitationalInfluence(age) // influence of gravitation, branches bend towards earth

growthInterruption(age, probability) // an interrutption in growth, leaving some years out

wobbliness(age, deviation) // curved branches
